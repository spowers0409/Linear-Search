# Python Linear Search Algorithm

This project originally started out as a C++ program. For CS-499 Computer Science capstone I am tasked with translating that program to Python as you will see below.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

These are the tools that I used and you will need:

* Visual Studio 2019
* Python 3.9 
* Windows 10

### Installation

Use the below command to include a clone of this repository into a local repository. After cloning, open up Visual Studio 2019, search and open the folder containing your new local repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/spowers0409/Linear-Search.git
```
<!--
## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks.

## Purpose for this program

The project is a Linear Search algorithm of which there is a pre-set array and when a user enters in an integer input, the algorithm reads through the array to return whether the user input has a match or not.

If a match is found then the program will return and print the location of the user input inside the array.

If not then an error will return to let you know that a match was not found.
